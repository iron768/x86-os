# x86-os
A small operating system made by using the tutorial https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial and https://wiki.osdev.org/

I implemented some fixes but since I have accomplished my goal of getting a better understanding of x86 Assembly and C before my assembly and computer architecture course, this project is considered abandonded, feel free to fork and do what you want with it though.

## Requirements
I ran this on a M1 Mac, I think the following depedencies should be the same on Linux (and for Windows users you can use WSL).
```
qemu
i686-elf-gcc
i686-elf-ld
i686-elf-gdb
```

## How to run
run `make run` and a qemu window should pop up
